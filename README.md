Collection of commands to synchronize Github repositories with Crowdin translations

## How does it work?

Synchronizing a Github repository with Crowdin translations can be performed in a few steps.

First, you must tell Crowdin which keys to translate. In order to do that, you have to select the "source" locale from
which your contributors will make their translations.
All translation keys are located in different files that you can configure using a Symfony Finder.
Nelson provides a command (`push-translation-keys`) to send new translations to Crowdin from the source locale.

Once the keys have been sent, your contributors will have the ability to edit, add and delete new translations in their
language.

Next, When the keys have been translated, you must pull them back in your Github repository.
This command (`pull-translations`) tells Crowdin to create a package for each language, downloads the packages and
checks the differences with your up-to-date repository.
You can set an option in this tool to only pull languages that are translated to at least a given percentage (e.g. 90%).
If it detects differences (new translations, deleted translations or modified translations), it automatically creates a
new Pull Request on your repository.
Finally, you have the option to manually accept or refuse the Pull Request, depending on its content. This last command
can be automated via a Cron.

And voilÃ ! Your GitHub repository will always be up-to-date and users will have the latest translations.

## Installation

**Warning** You must create your own fork in a dedicated git repository that will only be used for this purpose.
This will allow you to pull translations and create pull requests.
You must **never** run the following commands using your main repository,
because Nestor merges the latest commits automatically.

```
  $ git clone git@github.com:akeneo/nelson.git
  $ cd nelson
  $ docker-compose build
  $ docker-compose run --rm php composer install
```

## Create your own configuration

This package includes an example of configuration located in `app/config.example.yml` that you should adapt according to
your settings and save it as `app/config.yml`.

If you want to manage several configurations for multiple projects, you can use `--config_file=yourconfig.yml`.

## Configure SSH authentication

You will probably need to authenticate with your ssh key before being able to clone from the source repo or push to the
fork. We provide to override possibilities to enable ssh authentication:
`docker-compose.ssh-auth-sock.yml` and `docker-compose.ssh-keys.yml`.
- The first one is made to activate authentication via your SSH agent
- The second is a volume mount where you will put the private and public ssh keys you want to use

You can copy the one of your choice to a docker-compose.override.yml to enable ssh on your server: 
`copy docker-compose.ssh-auth-sock.yml docker-compose.override.yml`.

## How to use it?

- To display languages that are going to be synchronized

  `$ docker-compose run --rm php app/console nelson:info-translated-progress`

- To Create language packages in Crowdin

  `$ docker-compose run --rm php app/console nelson:refresh-packages`

- To push the new translation keys to Crowdin

  `$ docker-compose run --rm php app/console nelson:push-translation-keys`

- To pull translations (creates PR to your main repository)

  `$ docker-compose run --rm php app/console nelson:pull-translations`

## Update the crontab

You can set up a crontab to run Nelson commands on a regular basis.
The first step is always to refresh the Crowdin package to get the latest updates.
To update crontab, use `crontab -e`.

An example of crontab to push new keys every friday and create pull requests every saturday:

```
30 * * * * cd /path/to/nelson/ && docker-compose run --rm app/console nelson:refresh-packages > /tmp/nelson_refresh.log 2>&1
0 4 * * 1 cd /path/to/nelson/ && docker-compose run --rm app/console nelson:pull-translations > /tmp/nelson_pull.log 2>&1
0 5 * * 1 cd /path/to/nelson/ && docker-compose run --rm app/console nelson:push-translation-keys > /tmp/nelson_push.log 2>&1
```

## Testing

You can use the shipped docker container to develop and test.

Launch tests in the docker container:

```
make tests
```

Launch a command with XDebug:

```
XDEBUG_MODE=debug docker-compose run --rm php app/console nelson:refresh-packages --config_file=community-1.x-2.x.yml
```

Automatically fix your code style:

```
docker-compose run --rm php vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.php_cs.php
```
